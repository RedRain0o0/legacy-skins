# Legacy Skins
Legacy Skins is a compatibility mod for [Legacy4J](https://modrinth.com/mod/legacy4j) and [Customizable Player Models](https://modrinth.com/plugin/custom-player-models). It is entirely resource driven, meaning adding a new skin pack is as simple as applying a resource pack!

<!-- For a tutorial on how to make a skin pack, check out !ADD YOUTUBE LINK! for a video tutorial or !ADD WIKI LINK! for a text rundown on everything. -->
